# Angular 5 without CLI

npm install

## if you don't have a webserver
```
npm run serve-dev
```

and navigate your browser to

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## If you have a webserver and only need to compile Typescript

```
npm run compile-dev
```

What it does is only to run `ngc -w` which is running the Angular Template compiler (Typescript compiler wrapper)
